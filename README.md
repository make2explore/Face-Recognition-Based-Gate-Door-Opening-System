## Face-Recognition-based-Door-Gate-Opening-System.

In this session,  we are going to see a new project. Face Recognition based Gate/Door Security system. This system will open the Gate only when, Authorized person is detected/Recognized on Camera. We will use Raspberry Pi 4 development board, Python programming, Deep Learning Techniques, We will also use different computer vision libraries like, Tensor flow, Keras Etc.

Python and CPP codes are given above.
